        Throw down all the stuff in the kitchen hide head under blanket so no one can see. Sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry catching very fast laser pointer yet purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table. Walk on keyboard lick the other cats. Hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy make meme, make cute face playing with balls of wool ccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttssssssssssssssss but give me attention or face the wrath of my claws, scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me and sleep on keyboard. I can haz my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too catch eat throw up catch eat throw up bad birds, for experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo and purr purr purr until owner pets why owner not pet me hiss scratch meow yet claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand sitting in a box.
